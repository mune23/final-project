                    the 2005 live action film. After the shooting for the film ended the Fujinoki's 
                    (the owners of the store) were given the Fujiwara Tofu Store sign and decided to
                     keep it up. After the owner, Mr. Fujinoki, passed away in 2008, the shop was 
                     closed in 2009 and was demolished in 2010. The sign now resides in the Ikaho 
                     Toy, Doll & Car Museum, alongside a replica of the storefront.</p>
